# PetshopApplication2019
Goal of the project is to learn how to develop Web Application using Clean Architecture throughout the 3rd semester of studies at Business Academy Southwest. Project starts from developing simple console based app that uses in-memory list for data storage that would slowly transform into fully functional and deployed Web Application that will use SQL Server for data storage. Reason for such an approach is to learn concepts sequentially and see the power of Clean Architecture by how easy is to replace different components when having a well-designed application.
